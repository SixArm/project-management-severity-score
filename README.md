# SixArm.com → Project management → <br> Severity score

<img src="README.png" alt="Severity" style="width: 100%;"/>

Severity score is a simple way to rank items, such as goals, tasks, issues, etc. This page explains the task severity score that our teams use.

* Severity 1 = Minimum
* Severity 2 = Minor
* Severity 3 = Medium
* Severity 4 = Major
* Severity 5 = Maximum

You can freely customize this task severity score for your own needs. We welcome feedback and also suggestions for improvement. These are thanks to many clients and many years of experience.
